        description1: "In January 2025, Mode to Code began teaching classes at Chinese American International School, a private school in San Francisco. One of the first classes in our program, it helped solidify our curriculum and teaching methods. This course was taught by a host of Mode to Code instructors, including Jacob, Rohan, Caroline, and Ella. The class was a great success, with students learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The students were engaged and excited to learn, and many expressed interest in continuing their coding education.",
